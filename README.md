# Steam Remover

Complete removal of Steam and its registry keys.

I created this script in around 30 minutes to address the issue my friend encountered when switching to the beta client, which prevented Steam from loading and provided no direct option to disable the beta. Its purpose is to reset all Steam settings and completely remove the application from your system.

Then when you next install steam it will be on default settings.


## Features

- Cleans all files in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\" and "C:\ProgramData\Valve"
- Removes Mostly all the reg keys I know that steam makes
- Lightweight & fast
## Info

```
Maded in Windows Command Prompt scripting. aka .bat
```
